### Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing! This repository is intended to be clear and showcase-ready. Please follow these steps:

2. Make your edits with clear naming and small, focused commits
3. If you add features, update `README.md` accordingly
4. Open a Pull Request using the provided template

Coding/style notes:
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Prefer small, composable functions and early returns
- Keep platform-specific paths out of the code when feasible; use environment variables or configuration
- Avoid committing build artifacts or large binaries unless they are intentional assets (e.g., `.dae` inside `text_3d_models/`)

By contributing, you agree to follow the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
